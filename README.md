# Biblical Density
We wondered -- "What is the distribution or density of writings through time of the history and teachings recorded in the bible?" 
__Notes__:
(These could be issues...)
* Dates extracted from https://www.biblegateway.com/blog/2016/02/when-was-each-book-of-the-bible-written/
* Chapters from http://www.biblestudy101.org/Lists/statisticsHB.html
* Word count from https://overviewbible.com/word-counts-books-of-bible/
* Assigned negative value to BC. Estimated -2000-- -1900 for Job. Estimated -4000 as beginning time for Genesis.
* Could also do chapter/verse/word/letter density
* Could add Book of Mormon (Ether, etc.)
* What about geographic density
* Page counts taken from KJV
* Books like Genesis are non-uniform. We could do a verse-by-verse analysis.
